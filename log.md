# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Goal: Learn Vue, React, Tailwind and branch to backend

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Restarted vue crash course. Added templates, got lost for a bit, realized my notes are lacking steps assuming the future me would understand it, and the future is here. I completely forgot it. I need to add reading of jobs json file.

**Thoughts**: Future proof your notes.
