# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Goal: Learn Vue, React, Tailwind and branch to backend

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Restarted vue crash course. Added templates, got lost for a bit, realized my notes are lacking steps assuming the future me would understand it, and the future is here. I completely forgot it. I need to add reading of jobs json file.

**Thoughts**: Future proof your notes.

### Day 11: June 14, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to submit emit data, click data, and objects

### Day 13: June 21, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours trying to understand why reversing checkbox isn't working only to realize it's attached to a v-model. Transferred data to json-server and created post function.

**Thoughts**: I really shouldn't rely too much on AI support or google searches.
